  - ✅ Tailwind CSS (Updated to v4)
  - ✅ Next.js (Updated to 15.2.2)
  - ✅ React (Updated to 19.0.0)
  - ✅ Sanity (Updated to 3.79.0)

  - Manual testing completed and all functionality working as expected
  - Sanity integration confirmed working with React 19 and Next.js 15

### Unused Supabase Integration

✅ RESOLVED: Supabase integration has been completely removed

- Previously included:
  - Authentication functionality
  - Protected route example with dummy content
- Resolution:
  - Removed all Supabase dependencies
  - Removed auth components and routes
  - Removed middleware and configuration files
  - Cleaned up environment variables

### CSS Implementation Issues

- ✅ RESOLVED: Converted SCSS to standard CSS and removed redundant files
- There's an inconsistent mix of:
  - Tailwind CSS utility classes
  - ✅ Removed redundant global.scss files
  - ✅ Converted global SCSS styles to standard CSS
- Recommendation:
  - ✅ Convert SCSS to standard CSS (Completed)
  - Consistently use Tailwind utility classes throughout the project
  - ✅ Remove redundant stylesheet files (Completed)

### TypeScript Type Safety

- Current type safety in the project can be improved
- Recommendation: Implement auto-generated types from Sanity schemas
- Benefits:
  - Stronger type safety throughout the codebase
  - Reduced potential for runtime errors
  - Better developer experience with improved IntelliSense

### UI/UX Issues

- Hero images on mobile:
  - Images are too tall, making it unclear that there's more content below
  - Recommendation: Reduce the height of hero images on mobile screens
- Image scaling problems on large screens:
  - Portraits not displaying properly (people's heads are getting cut off)
  - Recommendation: Improve image handling for better responsiveness across screen sizes
- Image slider visibility issue:
  - The image slider at the bottom of the website is not clearly identifiable as a slider
  - Recommendation: Add visual cues to make it clear that users can interact with the slider
- Mobile menu problems:
  - Menu icon is stylish but not immediately recognizable as a menu toggle
  - White menu icon disappears against white backgrounds
  - When open, some content (email, route descriptions) gets cut off on mobile screens
  - Recommendation: Improve mobile menu with a more recognizable icon, add contrast or background to ensure visibility, and fix content overflow issues
- Email address overflow:
  - The email address displayed on the website is very long and extends beyond the screen width on mobile
  - This creates an unwanted horizontal scrollbar
  - Recommendation: Implement text wrapping for the email or use a more responsive container

### Accessibility Issues

- Button implementation problems:
  - Incorrect nesting of `<button>` elements inside `<a>` tags
  - This creates accessibility issues and is invalid HTML
  - Affects multiple components including CTAs and navigation
  - Recommendation: Refactor to use either buttons or links appropriately, not both nested
  - Impact: Affects screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Next Phase: Typeform & Zapier Implementation

After addressing the above improvements, we'll implement the new Ordering and Produce page with:

1. A dynamic produce list that can be managed through Sanity
2. Typeform integration for the ordering system
3. Zapier workflow setup to:
   - Send confirmation emails to customers
   - Store order data
   - Send notification emails to the client

This approach follows our earlier discussions about using third-party services for easier future management.

## Questions for Client

1. Are there any specific UI/UX improvements you'd like to prioritize?
2. Are there any upcoming features or changes planned that might impact our current recommendations?
