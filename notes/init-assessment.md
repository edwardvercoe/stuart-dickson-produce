# Stuart Dickson Produce Website - Code Assessment

## Executive Summary

This assessment provides an overview of the current state of the Stuart Dickson Produce website, identifying several areas for improvement. While the codebase is generally well-structured with good code quality, there are opportunities to modernize the technology stack, improve the user experience, and implement best practices. The recommendations are categorized by priority to help with planning and implementation.

## Initial Impressions

- The codebase appears to be well-structured and organized
- Code quality is good overall

## Platform Access Status

- Vercel.com - Successfully accessed the project
- GitHub - Successfully accessed the project and pulled the repo to local machine
- Sanity.io - Successfully accessed Sanity and ran it locally
- Typeform.com - Successfully logged in
- Zapier - Successfully logged in (currently on a trial with 12 days remaining)

## Areas for Improvement

### Sanity CMS Integration

- The current Sanity integration with Next.js is using an outdated approach
- Recommendation: Update to the current recommended integration method
- Benefits:
  - Cleaner codebase structure
  - Future-proofing the application
  - Improved editing experience

### Hosting Configuration

- The website is currently hosted on Vercel
- There are leftover configuration files for Netlify (another hosting provider)
- Recommendation: Remove unnecessary Netlify configuration files to reduce confusion and clean up the codebase

### Outdated Dependencies

- Several core dependencies are using older versions, including:
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Next.js
  - React
  - Sanity
- Recommendation: Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions
- Assessment:
  - Some breaking changes are expected but should be straightforward to resolve
  - No significant problems anticipated during the update process

### Unused Supabase Integration

✓ RESOLVED: Supabase integration has been completely removed

- Previously included:
  - Authentication functionality
  - Protected route example with dummy content
- Resolution:
  - Removed all Supabase dependencies
  - Removed auth components and routes
  - Removed middleware and configuration files
  - Cleaned up environment variables

### CSS Implementation Issues

- The project uses SCSS, which is not recommended for modern projects
- There's an inconsistent mix of:
  - Tailwind CSS utility classes
  - Two custom global.scss files (one appears unused)
  - Global CSS styles applied in one of the SCSS files
- Recommendation:
  - Convert SCSS to standard CSS
  - Consistently use Tailwind utility classes throughout the project
  - Remove redundant stylesheet files

### TypeScript Type Safety

- Current type safety in the project can be improved
- Recommendation: Implement auto-generated types from Sanity schemas
- Benefits:
  - Stronger type safety throughout the codebase
  - Reduced potential for runtime errors
  - Better developer experience with improved IntelliSense

### UI/UX Issues

- Hero images on mobile:
  - Images are too tall, making it unclear that there's more content below
  - Recommendation: Reduce the height of hero images on mobile screens
- Image scaling problems on large screens:
  - Portraits not displaying properly (people's heads are getting cut off)
  - Recommendation: Improve image handling for better responsiveness across screen sizes
- Image slider visibility issue:
  - The image slider at the bottom of the website is not clearly identifiable as a slider
  - Recommendation: Add visual cues to make it clear that users can interact with the slider
- Mobile menu problems:
  - Menu icon is stylish but not immediately recognizable as a menu toggle
  - White menu icon disappears against white backgrounds
  - When open, some content (email, route descriptions) gets cut off on mobile screens
  - Recommendation: Improve mobile menu with a more recognizable icon, add contrast or background to ensure visibility, and fix content overflow issues
- Email address overflow:
  - The email address displayed on the website is very long and extends beyond the screen width on mobile
  - This creates an unwanted horizontal scrollbar
  - Recommendation: Implement text wrapping for the email or use a more responsive container

## Recommendations by Priority

### High Priority (Technical Debt & Critical UX Issues)

1. Update all core dependencies to their latest stable versions
   - Effort: Medium
2. Fix horizontal scrolling issue caused by long email address

   - Effort: Low

3. Optimize hero images on mobile to improve user experience

   - Effort: Low

4. Fix image scaling problems on large screens (portrait cutoff issues)
   - Effort: Low

### Medium Priority (Modernization & Improvements)

5. Modernize the Sanity-Next.js integration to follow current best practices

   - Effort: Medium-High

6. Standardize the CSS approach:

   - Convert SCSS to CSS
   - Use Tailwind utility classes consistently
   - Remove redundant stylesheet files
   - Effort: Medium

7. Improve mobile menu usability:
   - Use a more recognizable menu icon
   - Add contrast to ensure visibility against all backgrounds
   - Fix content overflow issues in the expanded menu
   - Effort: Medium

### Lower Priority (Cleanup & Enhancements)

8. Remove unnecessary Netlify configuration files

   - Effort: Low

9. Improve type safety by implementing auto-generated types from Sanity schemas

   - Effort: Medium

10. Enhance the image slider with clear visual indicators

    - Effort: Low

11. ✓ Remove Supabase integration if confirmed unnecessary
    - Effort: Low
    - Status: Completed
    - Actions taken:
      - Removed all Supabase dependencies
      - Removed auth components and routes
      - Removed middleware and configuration files
      - Cleaned up environment variables

## Next Phase: Typeform & Zapier Implementation

After addressing the above improvements, we'll implement the new Ordering and Produce page with:

1. A dynamic produce list that can be managed through Sanity
2. Typeform integration for the ordering system
3. Zapier workflow setup to:
   - Send confirmation emails to customers
   - Store order data
   - Send notification emails to the client

This approach follows our earlier discussions about using third-party services for easier future management.

## Questions for Client

1. Are there any specific UI/UX improvements you'd like to prioritize?
2. Are there any upcoming features or changes planned that might impact our current recommendations?
