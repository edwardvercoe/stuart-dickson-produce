  - Recommendation: Reduce the height of hero images on mobile screens
- ✅ Fix image scaling problems on large screens
  - Portraits not displaying properly (people's heads are getting cut off)
  - Effort: Low
- ✅ Image slider visibility and interaction:
  - Previous issues:
    - Slider was not clearly identifiable as interactive
    - Inconsistent behavior across devices
    - Poor visibility of inactive slides
  - Resolution:
    - Implemented responsive slide sizing (85% width on mobile, 65% tablet, 55% desktop)
    - Added smooth opacity transitions (active: 100%, inactive: 50%)
    - Improved touch interaction handling
    - Updated pagination dots to match brand colors
    - Optimized performance with hardware acceleration
    - Fixed centering issues across all screen sizes
- ✅ Mobile menu improvements:

    - Menu icon was stylish but not immediately recognizable
    - White menu icon disappeared against white backgrounds
    - Content overflow issues on mobile screens
  - Resolution:
    - Implemented custom animated SVG menu icon that transforms between hamburger and X

    - Fixed content overflow with max-height and scrolling
    - Improved hover states and transitions
    - Enhanced accessibility with proper aria-labels
    - Added smooth animations for menu items
- ✅ Email address overflow:
  - The email address displayed on the website is very long and extends beyond the screen width on mobile
  - This creates an unwanted horizontal scrollbar
  - Recommendation: Implement text wrapping for the email or use a more responsive container

### Accessibility Issues

- ✅ Button implementation problems:
  - Previous issue: Incorrect nesting of `<button>` elements inside `<a>` tags
  - Resolution: Refactored to use buttonStyles directly on link elements
  - Fixed across Hero, CarouselCTA, FeaturedCTA, and GoogleMapBlock components
  - Impact: Improved screen reader compatibility and HTML semantics

## Next Phase: Typeform & Zapier Implementation

After addressing the above improvements, we'll implement the new Ordering and Produce page with:

1. A dynamic produce list that can be managed through Sanity
2. Typeform integration for the ordering system
3. Zapier workflow setup to:
   - Send confirmation emails to customers
   - Store order data
   - Send notification emails to the client

This approach follows our earlier discussions about using third-party services for easier future management.

## Questions for Client

1. Are there any specific UI/UX improvements you'd like to prioritize?
2. Are there any upcoming features or changes planned that might impact our current recommendations?
